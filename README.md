I'm looking for an inspiring Developer role (full stack) where I can continue to learn new things every day, in an organisation that loves developing great software and invests in its employees.

<div id="skills"><h2><a href="#TOC">Skills</a></h2></div>
In the business consultant/analyst roles I have had during the latter half of my career, I have often acted as a translator between the needs of software users and the development teams.
These years of experience have honed my problem solving skills and I know I will enjoy and do well in a developer role solving problems on the 'other side of the fence'.<br>
I love to solve problems (I consider myself to be very good at it) and I enjoy learning new things and getting to grips with new technologies. I get a huge amount of satisfaction from getting computer programs to do my bidding.<br>
From prior roles, I have developed a great eye for well designed software from a user's perspective and have now added strong backend coding and database design to my list of skills. I always take great pride in my work and am meticulous in my attention to detail.<br> 

<h3>Additional Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn new processes and software quickly</li>
<li>Very strong programming/logical and numerical abilities</li>
<li>Full project lifecycle experience</li>
<li>Strongly computer literate with an excellent working knowledge of a wide variety of application programs, (strong skills in Excel and MS Access) and Enterprise Information Systems</li>
<li>Strong software and user interface design knowledge</li>
<li>Strong financial/accounting knowledge</li>
<li>Self motivated, conscientious and responsible</li>
<li>Strong communicator with excellent written skills</li>
<li>Confident and effective in relating to people</li>
<li>Organised and methodical</li>
<li>Personable and professional in manner and presentation</li>
</ul>
